This repository assembles nowcasts of hospitalizations due to COVID-19 in Germany in a standardized format. The repository is run by members of the [Chair of Econometrics and Statistics at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://statistik.econ.kit.edu/index.php) and the [Computational Statistics Group at Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies](https://www.h-its.org/research/cst/), see [below](#forecast-hub-team).

An **interactive visualization** and additional information on our project can be found on our website soon.

## Contents of the repository

The main contents of the repository are currently the following:

- `data-processed`: nowcasts in a standardized format
- `data-truth`: truth data from RKI in a standardized format


## Guide to submission

Submission for actively contributing teams is based on pull requests. Our wiki contains a detailed [guide to submission](https://github.com/KITmetricslab/covid19-forecast-hub-de/wiki/Preparing-your-submission). **Nowcasts should be updated in a weekly rhythm. If possible, new nowcasts should be uploaded on Mondays.**
