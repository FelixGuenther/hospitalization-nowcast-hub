# Hospitalization Nowcast Hub

## A collaborative nowcasting project

**Contact**: forecasthub@econ.kit.edu

## Purpose

This repository assembles nowcasts of the seven-day hospitalization incidence due to COVID-19 in Germany in a standardized format. The repository is run by members of the [Chair of Econometrics and Statistics at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://statistik.econ.kit.edu/index.php) and the [Computational Statistics Group at Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies](https://www.h-its.org/research/cst/), see [below](#forecast-hub-team). It is based on [data](https://github.com/KITmetricslab/hospitalization-nowcast-hub/wiki/Truth-data) from Robert Koch Institute which we have processed for the purpose of nowcasting.

An **interactive dashboard** and background information can be found [here](https://covid19nowcasthub.de/).
