APCtools: An R Package for Descriptive and Model-based Age-Period-Cohort Analysis

Age-Period-Cohort (APC) analysis aims to differentiate relevant drivers for long-term developments
and is used in many fields of science.
The critical challenge in APC analysis is that the main components age, period and cohort
are linearly dependent (e.g., cohort = period - age).
Accordingly, flexible methods and visualization techniques are needed to properly disentagle observed temporal association structures.
We introduce APCtools, the first sophisticated R package that covers all aspects of APC analysis.
The package comprises functions both for descriptive and regression model-based analyses.
For the former, we use density (or ridgeline) matrices and adapted heatmaps as innovative
visualization techniques that build on the concept of Lexis diagrams.
Since Lexis diagrams and derived visualizations share the problem of visually underrepresented diagonals
we offer hexagonally binned heatmaps (hexamaps) as an alternative in which all three axes have similar visual weight.
Model-based analyses build on the separation of the temporal dimensions based on generalized additive models
and can be used to simultaneously account for further control variables.
The main temporal effect is estimated based on a tensor product
interaction surface between two dimensions, representing the third dimension on its diagonal.
Additional to heatmap and hexamap visualizations of the resulting tensor product estimate,
partial APC plots allow for detailed insights in the dependency structure among the temporal dimensions.
